ASSIGNMENT COMPLETION SUMMARY
GET211 - CPU Instruction Cycle Simulator Extension
Group 14 | Due: January 5, 2026
================================================================================

STATUS: ✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS COMPLETED AND TESTED

CRITICAL BUGS FIXED
===================

1. ⚠️ FATAL BUG - Switch Statement Structure
   Problem: Default case was placed in the middle of the switch statement
            after JUMP, making ALL subsequent ALU instructions (ADD, SUB,
            MUL, DIV, AND, OR, NOT, JNZ) unreachable code.
   Impact: Simulator would have failed completely for arithmetic operations
   Fix: Moved default case to the end of switch statement
   Status: ✅ FIXED

2. ⚠️ Missing Addressing Mode Support in ALU Operations
   Problem: getValue() function only supported immediate and register modes
   Impact: Could not use indirect/indexed addressing in ALU operations
   Fix: Extended getValue() to support all 4 addressing modes
   Status: ✅ FIXED

3. ⚠️ Missing UI Elements
   Problem: JNZ not listed in supported opcodes, Z flag not displayed
   Impact: User confusion, limited visibility
   Fix: Added JNZ to UI list, added Z flag display element
   Status: ✅ FIXED


FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
====================

✅ NEW ALU INSTRUCTIONS (25 marks)
   • SUB - Subtraction with Z flag update
   • MUL - Multiplication with Z flag update
   • DIV - Division with zero-check and Z flag update

✅ ADDRESSING MODES (25 marks)
   • Immediate: #value (e.g., LOAD R1, #100)
   • Direct Memory: address (e.g., LOAD R1, 500)
   • Register-Indirect: (Rn) (e.g., LOAD R1, (R2))
