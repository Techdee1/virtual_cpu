Test Program 1: Arithmetic Operations and Immediate Addressing
================================================================

This program demonstrates:
- All ALU operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, NOT)
- Immediate addressing mode (#value)
- Direct memory addressing

Program:
--------
100: LOAD R1, #15
101: LOAD R2, #3
102: ADD R3, R1, R2
103: SUB R1, R3, R2
104: MUL R2, R1, #2
105: DIV R3, R2, #4
106: LOAD R1, #12
107: LOAD R2, #5
108: AND R3, R1, R2
109: OR R1, R3, R2
110: NOT R2, R1

Expected Results:
-----------------
After instruction 100: R1 = 15
After instruction 101: R2 = 3
After instruction 102: R3 = 18 (15 + 3)
After instruction 103: R1 = 15 (18 - 3)
After instruction 104: R2 = 30 (15 * 2)
After instruction 105: R3 = 7 (30 / 4)
After instruction 106: R1 = 12
After instruction 107: R2 = 5
After instruction 108: R3 = 4 (12 & 5 = 1100 & 0101 = 0100)
After instruction 109: R1 = 5 (4 | 5 = 0100 | 0101 = 0101)
After instruction 110: R2 = -6 (~5)

Memory Setup:
-------------
(No additional memory needed for this test)
