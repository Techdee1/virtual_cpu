Test Program 2: Advanced Addressing Modes
==========================================

This program demonstrates:
- Register-indirect addressing: (Rn)
- Indexed addressing: offset(Rn)
- Direct memory addressing
- STORE instruction with different addressing modes

Program:
--------
100: LOAD R1, #500
101: LOAD R2, #10
102: LOAD R3, (R1)
103: STORE R3, 600
104: LOAD R1, #100
105: LOAD R2, 50(R1)
106: ADD R3, R2, #5
107: LOAD R1, #200
108: STORE R3, 10(R1)
109: LOAD R2, (R1)
110: STORE R2, 700

Memory Setup:
-------------
100: LOAD R1, #500
101: LOAD R2, #10
500: 42
501: 99
150: 77
210: 88

Expected Results:
-----------------
After instruction 100: R1 = 500
After instruction 101: R2 = 10
After instruction 102: R3 = 42 (loads from memory[500] using register-indirect)
After instruction 103: Memory[600] = 42 (stores R3 to direct address)
After instruction 104: R1 = 100
After instruction 105: R2 = 77 (loads from memory[150] = memory[100 + 50] using indexed)
After instruction 106: R3 = 82 (77 + 5)
After instruction 107: R1 = 200
After instruction 108: Memory[210] = 82 (stores to memory[200 + 10] using indexed)
After instruction 109: R2 = 88 (loads from memory[200] using register-indirect)
After instruction 110: Memory[700] = 88

Notes:
------
- Register-indirect (R1) means: use the value in R1 as a memory address
- Indexed 50(R1) means: use R1 + 50 as a memory address
- This demonstrates pointer-like behavior common in real CPUs
